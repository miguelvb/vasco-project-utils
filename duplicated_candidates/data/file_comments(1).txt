#119204 at  => USNO red 1 has something funny, although its not central.
#43146 at  => Some blurred artifact in USNred1 is visible.
#88254 at  => Transient in USNO red1? One object vanishes.
#52658 at  => We have a variable star here! It's not in the center.
#99098 at  => Has this central galaxy moved? Or am I drunk?
#92342 at  => An artifact influencing the USNO red1 image? OK not a central candidate, but it looked interesting.
#12387 at  => This one is very very interesting! Some weird variable.
#72486 at  => USNO red1 image seems slightly tilted. Instrumentation.

#62681 at  => Here is a transient in POSS-1 red!
#47943 at  => The POSS1 red image does not exist. Don't be scared. Just run by hitting '>>' in the main screen.
#19698 at  => The central object vanished from the blue band in POSS 1.
#28219 at  => What a boring case.
#62218 at  => This image is pretty!
#5083 at  => I love watching all the bands at the same time! Although, this time I found nothing interesting in the center. Next time.
#145387 at  => Those vanishing stars are somewhere out there... we are gonna find them!
#108563 at  => Here's an object on the top-right of the central object that was only visible in the red band in POSS1.
#81018 at  => There's a defect here - but it's not so disturbing.
#25211 at  => now i'm testing
#42721 at  => i'm testing again
#143338 at  => test again
#148229 at  => Huh - the bright one on POSS1 blue goes missing from ALL the others. From its shape, it seems to be a satellite though.
#48570 at  => I didn't see anything, stars is not always in the center!
#122075 at  => I do not see any source at the center in any of the images
#146200 at  => "Cannot retrieve source image" error. Other than that, nothing special. There is a very bright star at the centre that might be affecting the light and data around it
#145230 at  => Very interesting, the object is seen in USNO red1, USNOred2   USNOblue2 (where it has moved), and is back at its original spot in panSTARRS i and z. Why isn't it at the sme place in USNO red1??
#23698 at  => The central object was not there in USNO's BLUE 1.
#51561 at  => Here's something weird going on in the non-central objects.
#142380 at  => This one's weird. We're in the middle of a gas cloud... the center object is behaving strange.
#141463 at  => This candidate is embedded in a big gas cloud. Nice.
#64066 at  => Those two objects in the center are very weak in the USNO blue 1 image.
#107495 at  => There is something weird there about the stars above the candidate. I can't figure it out.
#18457 at  => There is an interesting star visible in the PanSTARRS i, z, y bands that I don't see in the USNO bands. Except the IR band.
#38121 at  => The USNO blue 1 is rotated relative to the others. Hehe.
#66425 at  => The USNO red 1 band looks interesting! Somethign there at the bottom looks like if it has vanished.
#20515 at  => thats a big artifact in USNO blue 1.
#134137 at  => Something is funny and weird about the objects below the central one here...
#51867 at  => USNO red 1 has an additional object near the center.
#41512 at  => A very very red object, that seems to be variable too!

#10777 at  => And also at the bottom.
#104782 at  => In the centre you can see two objects in a line of about 45 deg. The line intersects with two nearby objects above and to their left at nearly 90 deg. In the first picture on the other screen (the old image) there is a starlike object below the leftmost of the last mentioned two objects. (This would be easier if I could draw a circle and say "Look here". :)
#81713 at  => To the left of the top of the two close together bright objects is a small object (A). In the original pic there is another object below (A)It doesn't appear in any of the PanSTARR images above.paul@palindrome.com.au

#97359 at  => These two don't really look the same at all...
#102675 at  => There is a very faint pair of stars that can only be seen when the contrast is high.
#115674 at  => Is this a galaxy or possibly planetary disk forming new planets?  Looks more like a galaxy than a star to me.  matthewlarrison@yahoo.com
#46242 at  => Unclear what the central object is. Looks like none. Therefore: Defect.
#141785 at  => Extremely fast moving star or other object only appears in USNO blue2 image.  Not a streak like you would expect but 9 individual points of light moving right to left or left to right in a line across the middle 3rd of image. matthewlarrison@yahoo.com
#89106 at  => It strikes me that an additional brightness appears on the right side of the image, only in the USNO red 1 image, but not in the rest of the USNO images. It does not seem to be an error or a duplication of the brightness of the star immediately above. What could it be?JesÃºs MÃ©ndezjealmenh@gmail.com
#100607 at  => In the USNO blue1 on the left side there is a "double star" not present in other images
#86624 at  => No object shown in the center of the old image. Likely due to reduced light gathering capability of old telescope.
#38481 at  => Rotate the new image to align surrounding objects. Clearly shows the central object moved.Joe Rando joe@randos.net
#4159 at  => How USNO Blue 1 was uploaded is different than the other color bands. USNO Red 1 cannot retrieve a source image at all with a defect on the PanSTARR r. There is clearly an additional 2 stars in the PanSTARR images that arenâ€™t present at all in the USNO images even with the proper rotation of the image for alignment. Iâ€™m not sure what to classify this. Shannon (shannonmdesalvo@icloud.com)
#44518 at  => In the upper left hand corner of the USNO images across all colorbands there is a bright 3rd light/star. It is brightest in the USNO Blue 1 image but still visible across all the bands. It is not visible at all within the PanSTARR images. The slides might not be completely lined up digitally but Iâ€™m still surprised to see no light at all in the same position that Iâ€™m seeing it in the USNO images.

Hard to determine if it is barely detectable in the USNO ir frame (not detectable in other colors) but is there for all the PanSTARR frames.

#86013 at  => Interesting! Look at target at 4 o'clock of central star. It could very well be a image defect but it looks somewhat like a gravitational lensing even around a bright galaxy or bright quasar? Double check coordinates perhaps with the SDSS quasar survey. It could also be just 2 faint galaxies positioned near a star. Too faint for USNO frames.

#85483 at  => faint target seen right of center in USNO blue1 in line with two brightest stars in field. I don't see it in the other colors. This is either missing in the PanSTARRs frames or has moved. Upper right star of polygon of stars in PanSTARRS frame? I think not given the blue1 frame shows the polygon  and the detection in question is not part of that grouping. bketzeback@apo.nmsu.edu
#112887 at  => USNO blue1 has defect.
#23794 at  => What appears to be a star 4 o'clock of bright central star in the USNO red1 is not visible in other USNO frames or in PanSTARR images. likely a defect in the red1 image but may be worth a curtesy look. bketzeback@apo.nmsu.edu

#29892 at  => If you align and layer the two pictures  of mission 29892 on top of each other and use the flash function, it seems like a star in the USNO picture, slightly left of the three stars forming a triangle shaped formation in the center, disappeared in the PanSTARR image.That caught my attention. And i went on to inspection.In the USNO red2 image you can see this star that is slightly to left of the three stars in the center. If you now look at the PanSTARR i and z pictures this star seems to have moved slightly to the left. So its not the central object that changed here in my opinion, but the one to the left that seems to have moved.
#61957 at  => When layering the pictures of mission 61957 and then using the flash option there seems to be a star that is only visible on the USNO picture and not in the PanSTARR picture. Therefor I went into further inspection and found that this star is only visible in the USNO red1 picture but not to be found in any of the PanSTARR pictures.You can see 4 Stars in the USNO red1 picture, and the one closest to the bottom left corner of the picture is not visible in any of the PanSTARR pictures. So maybe its not the central Star that vanished here but the one i described to you. Best regards, Jakob.( classickjack@googlemail.com )(Also the USNO blue1 picture from this mission seems to be defect ? At least it seems like there is an artifact or something in that picture not to be seen in any of the other pictures.)

#107402 at  => USNO blue1 shows a spec in the bottom center where PanSTARR g shows some kind of smudge.
#116695 at  => The object appears broadly similar in the  USNO-B1 images, however in the PanSTARRS images it appears brightest in PanSTARRS-i less bright in PanSTARRS g
#10295 at  => Lots of weird streaks on the PanSTARR images. Only y looks clean at all. And even that one has a shadow on the star. Another where I can't see the "original object". Robert Duff fugacity@gmail.com
#115985 at  => Based on the images I was shown, it looks like an object near the center has significantly moved to the right, between both images.  However, when I looked at the other USNO images, the "moving" object only appears out of position in USNO blue1.  In the other four USNO images, everything is the same as in the PanSTARR images.  So there's something weird going on with USNO blue1.
#132154 at  => USNO blue1 contains an object that disappears. USNO ir contains a different object that also disappears. USNO blue1, from center object, toward right side of frame about halfway from center frame to right edge. This object does not appear in any other frames.In USNO ir, it appears that object has transited to left-side of center, perhaps slightly diagonally toward lower-left corner.Ben Sizemore (graffixak@hotmail.com)

#129756 at  => Diffraction spikes may be the problem.
#76394 at  => It looks like a large object to the left of the original image has disappeared when compared to the right image, but this is just because of a flaw in the USNO red1 image.  red1 is the only picture that shows the "vanishing" object, so I'm marking it as a defect.
#93339 at  => There needs to be a way to view comments without submitting another
#148463 at  => USNO red1 has an object that disappears. USNO blue2 has a different object that also disappears.USNO red1, from center of frame, toward left frame edge along left-right centerline of frame, approximately 2/3 of the distance from center to left-edge center.

#54449 at  => in USNO blue1 what is that?and in the PanSTARR telescopes there is a ojbect that looks like a galaxyand it has moved a lot
#122848 at  => Usno blue1 has an object at the bottom left, and usno red1 shows presumably the same object which has now moved from bottom left to bottom right. The usno red1 image of that object shows the object at the bottom in a wierd shape.
#11881 at  => If you grid the photos as say 1 10x10 with 0,0 bottom left. The star at 3,2 has moved relative to all the other stars in the photo.
#97088 at  => "USNO red2" has a large, horizontal streak going across the image. None of the other images from either USNO or PanSTARR have this same streak, although it appears "PanSTARR i" does have a slightly visible, diagonal streak near the upper-left quadrant.
#53986 at  => Object only in USNO Blue 1
#50632 at  => Each of the PanSTARR photos have something strange going on with them. It's more than likely it's all just camera defects(especially with PanSTARR g), but just in case something weird really is going on, I figure it's better safe than sorry to submit this.

#129861 at  => USNO red1 has a bright object top right that is not visible on other USNO images nor PannSTARR images. It also seems that the other objects have move slightly, so maybe the object top right moved out of the image.
#80642 at  => there hasn't been any central object in any of the USNO images.
#18228 at  => There are mayor diferences with the big start position across the photos.
#103847 at  => The center start shows in other position depending of the photo
#71863 at  => by rotating the panstarr images by approx -20 degrees, you can see that the two bright objects top left of the usno images have a different position like if one of the objects was rotating around the other ( binary stars ? )
#56951 at  => ,
#33489 at  => First image missing,looks ok
#81213 at  => USNO Red 1 contains 2 potential defects or abnormal objects. One sting-like structure stretching from the bottom center of the image. There is also another object positioned to the middle right which can't be seen in other other color bands and has a noncircular shape.Josh KasapJoshKasap@gmail.com
#148314 at  => USNO red1 has a bright dot in the middle that is not visible on the other usno images. This dot is bot visible on the panstarr ilages as well. probably an artefact.
#80697 at  => USNO blue1 is missing central object that appears visible in other images. The green "mission accuracy" bar is reporting an abyssmal matching score, despite ideal image alignment.  You guys really have to get that green bar fixed. There is no way it is working correctly.  It rejects 1 out of 3 missions, despite good/excellent background star alignments!
#129046 at  => Can not align perfectly all the starts

#133679 at  => In the USNO ir image there seems to be an extra star that doesn's seem to be there on any of the other images.tamas.babud@gmail.com
#50458 at  => The accuracy counter seems to be behaving weirdly when the image is rotated or scaled. It shows high values when the objects are offset slightly, causing me to need to overlay the images incorrectly to submit without skipping.
#113336 at  => Object in top right has moved
#134608 at  => Most of the USNO images are difficult to discern but UNSO red2 shows an irregularly-shaped bright spot at its center which does not show up in any of the panstarrs.
#69189 at  => I feel like it's probably a defect but panstarr r has an object that looks a lot like a comet. Laytz94@gmail.com

#40800 at  => Hey, my name is Milutin(milutin01pesic@gmail.com) im 20 and a student of physics from Serbia, ive noticed that the picture with a tag "USNO blue1" differs not only from the pictures made later but also from the other pictures made in the time by the US navy. Im in no position to guess, but it looks like either a fast moving object or one that occurred I short amount of time and or in specific wavelengths the pic was taken on. Thanks in advance, Milutin.

#101590 at  => Hi, my name is Milutin(milutin01pesic@gmail.com), ive notice that the brightest star on these pictures has an almost jet-like formation next to it. Altho it looks like it can also be a galaxy and a far away or much dimer star as well. Thanks in advance, Milutin
#41207 at  => There is an object, towards the middle left, that is visible only in the USNO red2, and very faintly in the USNO red1, but nowhere else. However, because USNO red2 has an anomaly in it (hair strand?), it's possible that this is just some noise
#2765 at  => Object with length, left of center, on USNO blue1 is not visible on PanSTARR.

#137833 at  => It looks like a few changes going on, USNO blue1 top left and bottom right have gone in all other pics. 3 at middle left have changed position. 2 at top right have changed position and become 3.    John Purnell deepcreektv@gmail.com
#99121 at  => Possible defect on USNO red1
#67818 at  => USNO blue1 seems to have 2 extra stars that the other images do not have. USNO blue1 is also missing a star close to the center of the image. the image also seems to have 2 ghost spots- (2 small dark patches) with the noise it is unclear, but the singular star that disappeared may have been a pulsating variable star, because a very dim dot is visible in its location.

#99687 at  => All frames appear to be congruent, except for USNO red1, in which a rather faint star in the center of the frame appears very dim, and USNO blue1, in which it does not appear at all.  This could be due to lower resolution of these frames, but that is not certain.  bill@borchert.com
#107440 at  => Fairly faint object at center of frame seems to be missing in USNO blue1, possibly (but not conclusively) due to lower resolution of that frame.  bill@borchert.com
#146556 at  => A star in the middle-upper right portion of the image is missing from the 'main comparison' view due to it being so blue and faint that PanStarr G and R do not register it (i appears to), but is visible in UNSO Blue 2 above the bright center-right star.
#134571 at  => Inconclusive, due to low resolution of USNO frames.  bill@borchert.com

#9209 at  => PanSTARR g and PanSTARR i has image glitches
#48203 at  => Image glitch on USNO blue1 top right corner.Interesting object on USNO blue1 in top left segment: not visible on other spectrums, not visible on PanSTARR either. Another image glitch?
#90452 at  => USNO appears to have too much noise. 5 objects visible in an elongated pentagon shape - best seen on USNO red2. Central object and galaxy-like object in lower right segment seem to be unchanged related to each other.
#64485 at  => USNO has too much noise. Comparing USNO blue2 and PanSTARR i, the 5 most lumnous objects seem to be unchanged in relation to each other.
#7407 at  => Starting image cannot be retrieved. after inspecting others the central object didn't move.

#36659 at  => I do not see the central star in the usno images.
#20635 at  => This is a mystery - why flag it? None of the images have an object right in the center?
#28403 at  => just to the right of the star there is a faint object appearing on the right image but not in the left.
#28278 at  => The USNO blue1 missed the star but all others registered the object. Particularly clear for red1 and red2.

#17382 at  => USNO red1 shows object slightly below left edge of galaxy - approx. 1/3 from image bottom. Not visible in any other images.
#61196 at  => In USNO red1, in the upper part, close to the middle of the image there's a star which is not visible in any other image (USNO or PanSTARR) which can mean there's some sort of error (in the case all the USNO images were taken at the same time).My name is Alex and my e-mail is enola_enola2003@yahoo.com

#27071 at  => Not same image.
#5863 at  => Object to right of centre, visible in USNO blue1, not visible in other images.
#4880 at  => Lens flare artefact.
#86087 at  => This one's odd. USNO's red2 image clearly shows an object in the center of the image, and I can see slight hints of it in the red1 and blue2 bands. But in the panSTARR image set it seems to be absent from all bands. Maybe worth a look?- Martin Sandr (msndr@protonmail.com)
#96395 at  => USNO blue1 cannot be retrieved but otherwise all other images look the same.
#135865 at  => What is it on USNO blue1??? Also the object under the annomaly vanished. The star is visible also on USNOred1, but its much dymmer.majo84321@gmail.com

#24330 at  => Star above center galaxy only visible in USNO red1 image
#34194 at  => USNO blue1 is twisted slightly, and USNO red1 has an extra star on the top center of the image, as well as an extra object or a moving object just to the right of the left-most star.
#24383 at  => There is an object in USNO blue1 to the left of the central object that does not appear in the other colorbands or in PanSTARR. There is also an object in USNO red1 slight lower and to the right of the central object that does not appear in the other colorbands. It seems possible it might be a quickly moving object since there are 2 objects that seem to have disappeared in 2 different photos, but because of the defect in the USNO red1 photo, it seems possible one or both may also be a defect. I'm happy to help more if I can! My email is bjohnson11711@gmail.com. I hope you can have a good day!
#136341 at  => usno only visible in blue
#44933 at  => Strange object in USNO red1 left of center. Possible artifact?I don't think it's anything significant, but I'd like to know if I'm identifying artifacts correctly so I can accurately identify objects in the future for you guys! Could you let me know if this is the case? My name is Jordan Dodson-Streich and my email is jordan.c.streich@gmail.com
#59267 at  => Looks like a different camera orientation between the UNSO and PanSTARR.
#138775 at  => The third small star in the PanSTARR g and y images might just be an artifact
#39892 at  => The UNSO blue1 image was poor quality. The stars are there on the other filters.
#113370 at  => In the top right corner is a star in the USNO red image which isn't in any of the other images.
#120337 at  => USNO red2 has double object in the middle, not visible in any other USNO or PanSTARR.Nuutti Smedbergnuutti.smedberg@gmail.com
#6256 at  => the top two stars seem to have switched their brightness. other stars seem to be gone. Maybe these images are not matched correctly?
#39146 at  => USNO blue1 shows an extra white dot at the top center of the image that looks similar to a star. USNO red1 shows a very dim dot in the same place, but none of the recent images (PanSTARR) show a dot there. USNO blue1 also shows a strange white dot on the far right side of the image, slightly below center.
#117319 at  => The object at 5 o'clock under the bright star only appears in the UNSO blue1 image that was presented. I would hazard a guess at a passing asteroid than a missing star?
#75651 at  => Star with image USNO red1. There is a bright star located lmost in the very center of the photo. This will be the starting guide point. From this central star,  draw an imaginary line straight down (180Â°) from the central as tar to the bottom edge of the photo.Just to the right of this line close to the bottom edge of photo is a bright (red) light source. I cannot find this light source or any other images. This is perhaps most notable in the "PanSTARR r" image. I don't think this is a framing issue as the area under question seems well within frame edges on all images.Because I am new to this app,  I would appreciate any help or guidance from more experirnced members could give here. Thank you. Tim at nemec daht comPS. Not sure where these images sre taken but if I had to guess,  I'd say this is an image centered on the 3 stars  of Orion's belt with the Orion nebula between and slightly below a line connecting the lefy most and center stars of the belt. How can I tell if fhis is correct? Thanks
#57579 at  => Object occur about top center of 'USNO red1,' does not appear present in any other instant.-occurring only once, I assume artifact and move on.
#44704 at  => The stars are not showing on the PanSTARR image presented, but appear faintly in the PanSTARR Z image.
#44304 at  => USNO red1 has an extra star at the left of the image slightly below center.
#143826 at  => The UNSO red2 image shows the star I thought was missing from the 4 small stars around the centre, so they are all there.
#93156 at  => USNO red1 has an extra white dot at the far left of the image.
#19538 at  => USNO red1 seems to show a galaxy in the upper left corner that is rotated about 75 degrees from its duplicate in the PanSTARR image. it also has 2 extra white dots, one is to the right of the top star, and the other is near the bottom right corner of the image.
#148759 at  => There's 4 faint stars in the UNSO red1 image the lowest of these isn't showing in any PanSTARR filter.
#82043 at  => There's nothing in the center. Not in old picture or new
#86557 at  => There's an object near the centre of the UNSO red1 image. Looks like two faint stars close together. The extra object only appears on this one filter though, so my guess would be an artifact rather than a missing star.
#18162 at  => USNO Blue2 extra object lower right part.
#112795 at  => Central object (middle star) remains in same position, but the brightest star in the newer images has moving to the left of the image (and other stars) along with the smaller star besides it.
#72889 at  => USNO red1 has an extra white dot at the bottom center of the image.
#87348 at  => Not a missing star but all PanSTARR images show an extra star making a close pair in the centre.
#42333 at  => There is a weird thing on the bottom left part of the USNO red1.
#77993 at  => I can't see anything in the center of the source images.
#67457 at  => Two bright "stars" only visible in USNO blue1 - that makes it seem like they vanished because the chosen PanSTARR g image didn't include them. Apart from hat the center object seems to be the artifact from USNO blue2, red2
#68756 at  => One star on top of image in USNO red1 is missing everywhere else
#29874 at  => Star in lower left corner of USNO red1 is only visible there. Center object remains

#89164 at  => Missing source image for blue1
#20550 at  => what galaxy is this?
#63816 at  => No center object in USNO
#10945 at  => Looks more like a galaxy. Also, the source image for blue1 and red1 have a slighly different orientation than the other images.
#141248 at  => USNO blue 1 that I was presented with was poor quality. The stars are there in the USNO ir image.
#58037 at  => Object appears to actually be two objects.
#1 at  => hello
#2 at  => hi
#1 at  => test
#1 at  => wow nobody else is here
#69 at  => 69
#420 at  => 420
#149011 at  => The USNO blue 1 image shows a double star near the centre, it only appears in that filter from both cameras so I'd say more an artefact than a missing star.
#144669 at  => Star on the right side of image has moved a fair amount

#126126 at  => The subject does not appear on the UNSO image
#28522 at  => after using this site for a while, I have found that the USNO red1 band seems to have the most star-like defects, defects that look like missing stars, namely, extra dots. in this case, USNO red1 has 4 extra dots, with the largest one being slightly above the bottom left corner touching the edge of the image.
#36594 at  => clear motion of central object
#19411 at  => Hi! Apart from some dim objects showing on some plates only I think there are three missing (moving?) objects spotted on USNO blue1 picture. The second, bright on the left-center, and another dim under center-down star on the same picture. Another dim spot is to the left of the right-most bright star.Maciekwyjpies@gazeta.pl
#80296 at  => USNO blue1 has an extra dot up-left of the center star.

Both objects do not show up on any of the other frequencies apparantly. One of them shows up in all the panSTARR photo's however, suggesting their absence in USNO blue1, red1, red2 and ir might be a quality issue?
#147817 at  => A star on the bottom moved. Center is still
#140802 at  => USNO red1 has an extra small white dot to the right and slightly up, of the largest star.

There are quite a few other objects on the image that I can't match up, but at the top right corner of USNO red1 there are 3 objects in a triangluar shape, there are similar one on the PanSTARR images that sort of match up when the new image is rotated anticlockwise a bit.cheryl-games@outlook.com

#55384 at  => Images don't match up
#121923 at  => Since the USNO blue1 picture seems to be taken at a different angle than the other pictures its hard for me to describe where the possibly moving object is. To the right of the bright star there is a cluster of 4 objects. The object in the bottom left seems to vanish on some photo's and might possibly re-apear in an other position on others.

#22180 at  => Bottom right corner theres a object in USNO red1 thats not on all others.
#52638 at  => 3 objects at right up corner seem like desappear or center object has moved.
#110874 at  => There seems to be some movement. In the two photos, the center object lines up but the surrrounding stars seem to have shifted.
#46756 at  => Looks like the large object moved
#9523 at  => movement right middle
#146611 at  => vanished rh side
#95322 at  => some moving object visible best on red1
#138935 at  => The bright object in the first picture (top-right corner) cannot be seen on any other picrute

#90620 at  => The two small stars near the bottom appear to have moved.James A. Tweetjamestweet@yahoo.com
#54260 at  => movement?
#90491 at  => Very interesting. USNO blue1 has very few distinguishable objects, one of them being the one in bottom-left corner. Although you can see this object in other pictures, it appears dimmer compared to some objects not visible in USNO blue1
#61982 at  => There is no central object visible on the initial image, but on here there is a faint object that shows on the centre of USNO blue2 but can't be seen in any other images

#72361 at  => PanSTARR i is damaged.
#61782 at  => USNO blue1 has an extra star in-between 2 stars in the bottom right of the image.
#73142 at  => Two stars move in this set of images. First the bright star in the upper left. Also a dim star in the middle right.James A. Tweetjamestweet@yahoo.com
#135515 at  => I suspect the obcejt to the lower-left of center has moved
#70036 at  => On the USNO blue2 band, there is a clear disappearing star, and it just so happens to have a galaxy as a backlight! In case the star somehow went dark, we would see a dark spot overtop of this right galaxy. My only concern here, is how its only visible in one of the many images, leading me to believe that it might be a false alarm.
#91008 at  => USNO red1 has some artifacts.
#32264 at  => USNO red1 has a white splotch that looks like either a galaxy, or just a defect with the original picture.

#78222 at  => Object appears in different place in USNO red1 than other USNO bands
#114523 at  => There seem to some kind of black object in USNOred1 what is it?majo84321@gmail.com
#78222 at  => I suspect any proper motion reports are due to this. By eye, the object does not appear to have moved between USNO blue2, red2, or IR and any PanSTARR band
#19251 at  => False detection of central object due to diffraction flares on USNO r1, b1, r2, ir
#62787 at  => Central object still there, possible proper motion on brighter star just right of center
#132817 at  => No central object. False positive due to elliptical galaxy?
#148048 at  => No central object in any band
#16595 at  => No central object
#97068 at  => The star appears to have shifted position relative to the other stars
#25020 at  => USNO images are unusually noisy. Unsure if there is a central object
#11654 at  => Nothing in the exact center, but there is something in the upper left quadrant for USNO red1 that is not in any other image.
#86207 at  => Possible proper motion of object at right edge of image
#124003 at  => Diffraction flare

#122093 at  => there is an object moving, it's close to central object and moving direction to 11 o'clock. red1, blue1, blue2, red2(marlenabobrowicz@gmail.com)
#99186 at  => Difficult to identify reference stars on USNO images. USNO blue1 has two defects that look like stars. Best I can tell, PanSTARR images need to be rotated ~20 degrees clockwise to match USNO images.
#54701 at  => Possible proper motion of an object at very top of screen, centered horizontally
#48476 at  => No central object? Everything appears normal otherwise
#126640 at  => The brightest object seems to have moved
#64300 at  => There appears to be an object on the left-center section of USNO blue1 image that is absent from all other images.
#149742 at  => USNO blue 1 does not match all of the other images in this set. Blue 1 seems to show a single object that looks like a possible asteroid or something similar. Jason Peter  jasonpeter971@gmail.com
#26743 at  => USNO blue1 shows an additional object near the center not in any other image
#51907 at  => In the USNO  blue1 image at about the 2  o'clock position, there seams to be a small star like object, but it is missing in all the other images.From m.j.bii2sea@yahoo.co.uk
#142313 at  => Nothing visible
#36319 at  => Central object only appears very faintly in USNO red1, red2, and IR bands. Appears not to have moved, but cannot verify exact position from main page overlay since it is using blue2 band.
#7702 at  => Central object detected may be a diffraction flare.
#120143 at  => False object - diffraction flare
#93408 at  => False object - diffraction flare
#1661 at  => The 2 small stars up right has become closer.USNO blue1 is rotated 45 deg anti clock wise.
#132612 at  => Object still there. Cannot align images due to missing source image.
#8203 at  => No central object? All else normal.
#37218 at  => Possible proper motion of object at top right corner of image
#65766 at  => No central object? All else normal.
#148327 at  => False center object - diffraction flare. Interesting matching dark spots/defects on USNO red1
#25640 at  => It's interesting how the center star is lighter and darker in some pictures.
#131805 at  => Object still there, missing USNO blue1 image, checked using inspect.

#26072 at  => There is an object to the left and low from the central object that is visible in the USNO blue1 and USNO red1 but not in the other images. Do not know if this could be a 'disappeared' star or an anomaly as it appears only in the blue1 and red1 and not blue2 red2 or ir. David Brookshire Vash_7734@Yahoo.com

#39743 at  => USNO blue1 has small object not visible in others
#146266 at  => No central stellar object but some of the stars have moved, However there is a central object that appears to be a galaxy it appears best in the PanSTARR images another nebula is a little higher in to the left which is visible in the USNO blue2 slightly in the red1 red2 and invisible in blue1 and ir. The galaxy is to faint in the USNO image for a proper alignment. David Brookshire Vash_7734@Yahoo.com

#84777 at  => object present only in USNO red2 at bottom approx. center
#133476 at  => the central object moved slightly - diference on red1 and the rest of existing pictures(marlenabobrowicz@gmail.com)
#30488 at  => I'm new to this. The original image does not clearly show a central star. It is like the USNO blue1. But it does show up on all 4 of the other inspect images and in all of the PanSTARR images. If I hadn't inspected, I would have thought that a star had shown up where there wasn't one before. So all normal, looks like it hasn't moved, does not show up well in blue1 spectrum.
#49199 at  => Unable to find object in centre of frame. Can only see bright object at bottom, and other objects away from centre.
#82048 at  => Not sure which is the "central object"
#81146 at  => on red1 there is something additional in the centre(marlenabobrowicz@gmail.com)

#32548 at  => Top right hand corner - missing star
#24502 at  => Images don't match up
#127978 at  => that's a lensflare
#96337 at  => I couldn't get the old images to line up perfectly with the new images. It's as if everything has shifted, but in different ways.
#144329 at  => the extra object is only visible in USNO red1
#147083 at  => I don't see a central object in the old image.
#51445 at  => I assume there's something wrong with the image for PanSTARR g, because there's three strange shapes at the top of picture that don't seem to belong (and aren't in any of the other pictures.) Also, there's a strange light beam that looks very odd coming off the central object (again, it might be something wrong with the picture.) I'm not sure if these pictures are damaged, but in the newer pictures there's lots of strange black lines coming off the central object, and in USNO RED 2 there's a streak at the bottom of the image, and in USNO RED 1 there's a weird squiggly white line down and to the left of the central object.
#70265 at  => I don't see a central object in the old image.
#36522 at  => there an extra dot on the top middle, but only seems visible in USNO blue1
#111939 at  => I'm guessing there's something seriously wrong with the pictures taken recently, because it looks like a huge object artificial object is in front of and or beside the central object in PanSTARR g and PandSTARR r. There are also weird shapes throughout those two pictures which look like damage to the picture. Also, in PanSTARR i the central object looks distorted with weird wavy shapes and lines coming off of it. The light coming off from it also looks strange in PanSTARR z.
#149870 at  => A bright light northwest of the central object has disappeared. It was only in the USNO red1 photo, and is not in any of the other ones. In that same photo there is also a strange elongated shape to the left of the now missing light that might still be there, but doesn't look like the same anymore. I'm not sure why, but there is definitely at least one missing object. Also it looks like there's a hair or something on the top left of the USNO blue1 photo. Just felt like mentioning it.
#92101 at  => big difference in light instansity - on blue1 the very central point is almost not to see, and on other pictures very visible(marlenabobrowicz@gmail.com)
#10294 at  => I don't know why the newer pictures of that main bright object look so strange. It looks extremely distorted, with odd shapes coming off of it.
#106878 at  => on blue1 there is one more spot in the centre of the pictureand looks like something moving close to the left star (blue1 vs blue2)(marlenabobrowicz@gmail.com)
#81400 at  => There's a light near the center of USNO blue1 that I don't think are in any of the other ones. There's also a tiny faint light on the right of USNO blue2 that I also don't think are in any of the other ones.
#95396 at  => All the lights around the central object seem to have shifted quite a bit. Not sure if maybe the picture is just tilted or something, but I can't get the objects to line up the way they should.
#63458 at  => on red1, on ~3o'clock is one more bright "pixel", than on the oter pictures
#2447 at  => Lots of distracting distortion and strange shapes on newer pictures.
#148447 at  => There is a star visible in USNO Blue1 near the top left that seems to have disappeared in later pictures.
#18582 at  => blue1 - bright spot very close to central object, invisible on other pictures(marlenabobrowicz@gmail.com)
#27068 at  => The objects all seem to be there, but there is something seriously wrong with the quality of the recent images. For example, PanSTARR i has tons of strange white shapes all over it. And the brightest light near the bottom center is messed up in all of the newer pictures. Not sure what's going on, but it looks awful.
#63287 at  => direction 10o'clock an object is moving(marlenabobrowicz@gmail.com)
#79241 at  => There are several objects missing. If you look at USNO red1, there is a large misshapen light above the brightest object that is missing in all the other pictures. There are also two lights directly to the left of the brightest object near the edge of the picture, and it looks like at least one of them went missing in some of the pictures. Also, in the center of USNO red1, there is a cluster of stars that I don'y see in any of the other pictures.
#110346 at  => USNO red1 image is unavailable; in general the images are rotated by varying amounts
#113987 at  => blue1 shows an object in the middle of the picture, which doesn't exist on other pictures(marlenabobrowicz@gmail.com)

#147459 at  => The object seen on the middle left side in the picture taken by USNO blue2 does not appear in any other given image. Judging by the shape, it seems to me that it is moving and possibly got distorted by the exposure time used.Mail: marcoscheiter@gmx.de

#128248 at  => The object just off the top edge of the frame with a large bloom around it seems interesting.  There coincidentally seems to be some kind of visual artifact affecting only this bloom in the PanSTARR images, though the artifacts differ from each other across the various bands.

#407 at  => Object only  very faintly visible in UNSO red2 but not in other UNSO bands
#133842 at  => Central object has gotten very much dimmer.All USNO to PanSTARR red 2m.j.bii2sea@yahoo.co.uk
#69088 at  => The central object remains, but another object in the 3 O'clock direction has either moved (perhaps to become two objects) --or vanished.Craig Danielscraig3ddd@gmail.com
#29649 at  => no central object
#64313 at  => The top of the center diagonal pair seems to have shrunk.
#71569 at  => PanSTARR g is slightly damaged.
#137164 at  => Vanishing object 10 o'clock from center. Clearly visible i USNO red2 but i think it's also detectable in USNO red1 and blue2
#28662 at  => USNO red1 picture has a star middle of the upper right corner and the middle. And this star moved right or disappear.
#82658 at  => There are 3 star like a triangle. This triangle in USNO blue1 picture has only 2 stars and same triangle in USNO red1 pictrus has 4 star.
#77764 at  => USNO blue1 has a bright object left of centre, that isn't in any of the other USNO or PanSTARR images.
#496 at  => Central star is unchanged, but it looks like there is a 'mover' on this image - third star from the left... and straight on 'till dawn ;)
#74688 at  => No central star in this image?
#10921 at  => Star just to the left of centre looks like if could be a 'mover'

#82059 at  => No central object in this image
#125504 at  => On USNO red2 there is a band of some kind that is Present on PanSTARR g,r,i, and z, but not on PanSTARR y. It also appears to have gotten smaller, and rotated. My email is huskiy57@gmail.com I am interested to know what you guys think.
#59812 at  => There is a defect on PanSTARR G. Now on PanSTARR r there is a "cloud" shaped object that isn't present on any other images.
#140600 at  => It apears all USNO images are have LOTS of missing objects that are present on the PanSTARR images. I think this is due to the tech at the time the USNO images were taken. This is very interesting nonetheless. My email is huskiy57@gmail.com .
#17900 at  => 2 things. The star in the middle seems like it disappears at different color bands/different resolutions. No UNSO candidates have the middle star (except for USNO red2, which may).Moreover, something is moving in the left side of the USNO images. In USNO blue 1, it's to the right of the bright star. In UNSO red1, it's to the left. In USNO blue2, it disappears completely. It does not appear in any other image, USNO or PanSTARR.
#92771 at  => There seems to be a lot of movement in this picture. First, the galaxy and two stars below the galaxy are not in the same position as they were before. Second, in USNO blue1, there is a star above the galaxy and two stars level with the galaxy. This star moves upwards in the image drastically throughout the USNO photos. It remains there through the PanSTARR photos.
#15668 at  => There is a small object just below the furthest right star of the large triple star group in the uSNO original image that is not present in the PanSTARR image.It's not visible on any of the color isolated images, only on the original image when threshold is adjusted. It is at the 5 o'clock position of the far right star of the triple group at the top. It's not particularly bright but it's not visible at all in the newer image.

#98424 at  => Object missing from USNO red 1 lower left quad
#64952 at  => Probably nothing but the scale seems off in some USNO images and that make it look as some objects have moved.
#114243 at  => There seems to be an object close to the center of USNO 1 that isn't visible on any of the others.However USNO red 2 has a scratch or something that goes straight through where the object would be so it may be some kind of defect.Eric Rowleyqwertyuiop@bredband.net
#93806 at  => Scratch (?) on USNO 2
#122830 at  => USNO blue1 is misaligned/rotated.

#139725 at  => There is one bright star lower far left segment of the image...when used as a reference point to aline the image up with, there are 3 other stars to the mid and upper right of the image which definitely do not align
#54169 at  => Whatever is in the top right has moved itâ€™s position relative to the two central objects.

#134665 at  => There's additional weird shapes on PanSTARR z and y photos
#148734 at  => On the UNSO Blue 1There is an apparent star at 10 o clock to the bright object. There is also a faint dot on the same image at the top edge of the frame, almost in line with the bright object. Neither are present in panSTARR g or all other images. Potential defects?David
#76167 at  => The USNO  Blue 1 there is a star present top of frame, not present in other images. plus the 3 small stars are nearer to the bright one on USNO relative to the Pan images
#13061 at  => USNO and Pan images do not alignDavid
#134679 at  => interesting images, looks like the stars are 2 sets of binaries how the second set of objects move upward. Also the set that is moving upward seems to be a trinary michael michaelchutchinson@live.com

#79818 at  => There is an object at the center-right in the USNO red1 picture that doesnt appear in any other pictures. And it doesnt seem like the picture is faulty.
#13851 at  => The central object seems to be moved only in the USNO blue1 image. In all other images, it is at a constant position.

#66013 at  => The object at the 1 o'clock position of the center most object (especially apparent in USNO blue1) is missing in the original image as well as the PanStarr color band images. Both images seemed aligned properly. I used the triple group in the lower left area.Submitted by Todd Pashak (todd.pashak@gmail.com) on 10/18/2021.
#66153 at  => ID 66153.  Two faint objects visible in the middle of image USNO red1.  Might be the same two objects visible in images PanSTARR i, PanSTARR z, PanStarr y, but they are angled/ inclined differently. Name: MornÃ© du Plessis. email: morne.duplessis@yahoo.com
